# Highland Cow
Welcome to the Highland Cow.  This is an application for scanning bar codes and storing those details to track what items you own.  This is not meant as a commercial inventory system but rather for tracking collectibles that end users might own.  

### Details
Currently this is just a webapp application that is not deployed anywhere.  The backend HTTP server is built with Go that stores data into a Postgres database.  The frontend is built in React using Vite.  I have incorporated Tailwindcss into the styling but this web app requires a lot more work on the front end to clean things up.

### Future Enhancements/Plans
I still need to build a React Native frontend to use the camera and scan bar codes and queries for details to be stored.
